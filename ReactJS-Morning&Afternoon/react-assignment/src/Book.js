      author: 'Edward Abbey',
      overview: 'No author encapsulated and celebrated the American Southwest more engagingly than iconoclast and raconteur Edward Abbey.

Though set in his beloved Southwest, Desert Solitaire beautifully and brashly captures the essence of the American outdoors, replete with disdain for those whod seek to spoil its natural wonder. – Jeremy G.',
